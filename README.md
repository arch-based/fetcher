  _The fetcher script prioritizes speed and resource efficiency by focusing on essential data retrieval with minimal overhead. This makes it a goodchoice when you need system information quickly and simply. The only tool that lets you become the elitist of Arch Linux._
  
  _The "fetcher" script is a lightweight Bash tool that displays system information very quickly._
  _Despite its compact size (under 70 lines), it offers a clear interface with ASCII art and nerd font icons for a unique aesthetic._
  _This focus on efficiency and visual appeal makes fetcher a great option for users who value both functionality and style._
  
  _This tool is mainly focused to arch-based distros and arch linux so don't be surprised if you do not see a logo of your distro here._
