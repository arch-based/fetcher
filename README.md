<h1 align="center">fetcher</h1>
<p align="center">A pretty system information tool written in bash</p><br>

The fetcher script prioritizes speed and resource efficiency by focusing 
on essential data retrieval with minimal overhead. This makes it a good
choice when you need system information quickly and simply.

 The"fetcher" script is a lightweight Bash tool that displays system information very quickly.  
 Despite its compact size (under 70 lines), it offers a clear interface with ASCII art and nerd font icons for a unique aesthetic. 
This focus on efficiency and visual appeal makes fetcher a great option for users who value both functionality and style.

This tool is mainly focused in arch-based distros and arch linux so don't be surprised if you do not see a logo of your distro here.
